# LabWorksFIrstSem
Repository meant to solve all works done during the Course of Project works in MIPT. All results completed as latex based presentations and jupyter notebooks math source 

Repository created in colaboration with [Masov. E](https://github.com/eMasov

# First Semester

| Num           | What About         | 
| ------------- |:------------------:|
| [First work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/LearningHowToUseOscillograph) | Main point is to get used to work with Oscillographs|
| [Second work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/CosmicRaysRadiation)         | Main point is to get familiar with the Poisson Distribution of Discrete values and compute its on 3 gigabytes data captured from usb-oscillograph|
| [Third work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/Young's%20modulus)            | This work meant to help us with concept of waves in solid matters (like in long metal bars), and task were to find Young's modulus for different types of metals|
| [Fourth work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/Coupled%20oscillators)       | This work meant to help us understand concept of synchron and anti-synchron oscillations of coupled pendulums|
| [Project](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksFIrstSem/tree/main/Project)       | Mechanical modeling of oscillations of systems with multiple degrees of freedom|

# Second Semester

| Num           | What About         | 
| ------------- |:------------------:|
| [First work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksSecondSem/tree/main/Vacuum) | Vacuum: High and Low |
| [Second work](https://github.com/hK04/LabWorksSecondSem/tree/main/Atmosphere%20gas%20Viscosity) | Air viscosity properties estimation |
